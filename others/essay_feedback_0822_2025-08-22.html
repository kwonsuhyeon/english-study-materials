            <div class="essay-content">Once upon a time, in a big city, there lived a boy named Billy. He was kind and always full of fun. Billy had a cat named 'Blacky' because of its shiny black fur. Billy and Blacky were best friends; they always did everything together. 

One sunny afternoon, Billy was reading a book about animals in his room. Suddenly, he heard a loud 'meow' from the garden. It was Blacky. He quickly ran outside to find Blacky with one of her legs stuck between the branches of a tree. Billy felt his heart pound and he began to cry. 

But then, he remembered his dad's words, "A brave heart can overcome any problem." Billy dried his tears, took a deep breath and thought about what to do. He went to the kitchen, grabbed a chair, and carried it to the garden. Standing on the chair, he could reach Blacky and gently freed her leg. 

Blacky was no longer stuck, but she was still in pain. Billy knew he had to help his friend. He carefully picked her up and carried her to the vet's office across the street. The doctor checked Blacky's leg and gave her medicine. After a few days, Blacky was back to her playful self again.

Billy felt happy. He learned that friendship is not just about having fun together, but also about helping each other in times of need. From then on, Billy and Blacky's bond grew even stronger. They were not just a boy and his cat anymore, they were a team. And together, they knew they could overcome any obstacle that came their way.

So, always remember, a true friend is someone who is there for you, not only in good times but also in bad times. That's what real friendship is about. And that's what Billy and Blacky taught us.</div>
